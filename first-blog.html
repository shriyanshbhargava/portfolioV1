        Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in
        React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL.
        The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel
        of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the
        community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did
        find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day
        but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot
        many people I know.
      </p>
      <div class="head">let’s talk about the course</div>
      <p class="para">
        Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course.
        Here’s the link. It’s free. I have embed the entire playlist below, you
        can watch it right here.
      </p>

        While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is
        little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for
        beginners.

        <br /><br />

        <b>pace</b> is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that you have to
        go back nor slow that you start doozing

        <br /><br />

        <b>full screencast</b> of code, I like where I don’t have to see
        someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on codepad.
        So, this was a huge +

        <br /><br />

        <b>great example</b> for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is
        an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL.
      </p>

      <div class="head">what you need to know to do this course?</div>

      <p class="para">
        To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
        <br />
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <br />
        <li>ExpressJS</li>
        <br />
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <br />
        <li>CSS & HTML</li>
        <br />
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <br />
        If you don’t know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself
        to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can be
        better than this.
      </p>

      <div class="head">what you get to learn from this course?</div>

      <p class="para">
        This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would need
        to make a graphQL app.<br />
        <br />
        <b>FOR THE BACKEND</b>
        <br />

        <li>Mutations</li>
        <br />
        <li>Queries</li>
        <br />
        <li>Resolvers</li>
        <br />
        <li>GraphiQL</li>
        <br />

        <b>ON THE FRONTEND</b>
        <br />
        <br />

        <li>query/mutation fire</li>
        <br />
        <li>parameterized query</li>
        <br />
        <li>composing multiple query</li>
        <br />
        <li>refetching queries on mutation</li>
        <br />
      </p>

      <div class="head">after the course</div>
      <p class="para">
        As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you
        have done the basics you can learn about:
        <br />
        <li>graphql subscriptions</li>
        <br />
        <li>@client i.e. managing local state</li>
        <br />
        <li>typescript support</li>
        <br />
        <li>authentication/authorization in the app</li>
        <br />
        <li>writing tests for graphql query/mutations</li>
        <br />
        <li>paginated queries</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current
          API being used in apollo’s documentation and everywhere in code.
        </li>
        <br />
